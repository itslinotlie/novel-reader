The final rendition of the ICS4U project series. Spending a total of 40 hours, this solo project integrates my interest for reading web-novels onto an application. With the JSoup library, an open source Java HTML parser, the program is able to mimic the reading experience like that of a website such as novelfull.com. The user experience is similiar to Tachiyomi, but minus the benefits Tachiyomi has (: The user can, in no order of quality, browse for novels, add novels to a library, read and navigate through novels, and view recommendations for new novels.
